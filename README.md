## Any Extra Notes?

I honestly tried my best with this. I think I got most of it to work, but I was having some issues with the checkbox conditionals; no code I tried seemed to work. I was also struggling with filling the JSON file with attributes once the survey was submitted. Currenlty a json file is being created, I am just unsure why it is not being populated once the survey is submitted. I think I am just missing some small things, but I have spent 6 hours trying to figure out these two errors and I just cant anymore. 

To run `pipenv shell` then `FLASK_APP=server.py flask run` 

Durring setup, you'll need a `.env` with DATABASE_URL in it.
